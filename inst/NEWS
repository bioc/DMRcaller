Version 0.99.3:
    - addressed a warning in plotLocalMethylationProfile when plotting 
      transposable elements on the negative strand.
    - in plotLocalMethylationProfile if regionType metadata column of the DMRs is 
      not specified or is not "gain" or "loss", the DMRs are drawn as a filled 
      box.
    - in plotLocalMethylationProfile the mean lines are plotted using shades of 
      colour, where lighter colours indicate fewer reads, while darker colours 
      indicate higher number of reads.

    - computeDMRs and computeDMRsBins were joined into one function computeDMRs. 
      This function takes four additional parameters: method, kernelFunction, 
      lambda, binSize. The method parameters selects which method to use and can 
      take one of the three values: "noise_filter", "neighbourhood" or "bins". 
        - If "bins" method is selected, then binSize parameter is required.
        - For "noise_filter" method, the user is required to specify the 
          windowSize in bp and the kernelFunction. The Kernel functions that 
          were implemented are: "uniform", "triangular", "gaussian" and 
          "epanechnicov". The triangular kernel function leads to the same 
          results as the previously implemented computeDMRs functions. Note that 
          the default parameters are set to select this method and kernel 
          function and, thus, all previous code should run. We implemented three 
          additional kernels: uniform, gaussian and epanechnicov. For Gaussian 
          kernel, the lambda parameter is required.
        - We implemented an additional method called "neighbourhood". This 
          method call individual cytosines as differentially methylated (DMCs) 
          or not and then attempts to merge the neighbouring DMCs within a 
          certain distance only if the difference in methylation levels is still 
          statistically significant after joining them. 
    - windowSize parameter of computeDMRs accepts only integers higher than 0
    - We joined computeDMGEs and filterDMRs into a single function called 
      filterDMRs. For the new filterDMRs function, we removed regions parameters 
      and now the method checks all supplied potential DMRs.
